I made this page to put all helpful things about programming, tech, and other topics from my blog in one spot.

If you need a cheap agent for many AI models, I suggest [T3.Chat](https://t3.chat). For just $8 a month, you get access to popular models. The creator, Theo Browne, is very active and quickly answers questions and ideas for new features. Most models come from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or other providers.

The same person also made [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/) – a good, simple, and cheap way to store files, better than S3. You can also use its website like a file host (up to 2 GB for free).

On my Mac, I use some tools that help me a lot:
- [Warp](https://warp.dev/) – a fast terminal that helps you type commands, handles many tabs, and works with AI models.
- [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) – a free and strong option instead of Docker Desktop for managing containers.
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) – a great tool for databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- [Hex Fiend](https://hexfiend.com/) – a quick hex editor that can compare files.
- [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me/) – a tool to change mouse settings, like how fast it moves.
- [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) – a good open-source browser based on Firefox.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) – a missing tool for installing software on macOS.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) – a tool to test APIs. Insomnia is also a good choice.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) – a great tool for notes and teamwork. For an open option, try [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

You can often find me playing Xonotic on the ["Jeff & Julius Resurrection Server"](http://145.239.66.73/resurrection.html). It's a game, like Quake 3 Arena, but with better graphics and more players. I used to play [Build and Shoot](https://www.buildandshoot.com/), but now Xonotic is my favorite because fewer people play Ace of Spades.

Why don't I list books here? Because I only read about politics, history, economics, or philosophy. For tech, I usually read new papers and articles. I suggest [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).
